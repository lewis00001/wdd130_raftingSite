                    <h3>Death has Dimples</h3>
                    <p class="t-text">
                        Sooo … I gave this trip 1 star. Let me explain. Kim, Alexis and I wanted to do something 
                        exciting to celebrate our high school graduation. We selected a nearby rafting company and 
                        were excited to meet Sean (our super cute rafting guide). So the trip started out well and 
                        I was looking very hot in my little yellow lifevest. Did I mention that Sean had the cutest 
                        dimple? Totally cute! Anyhow, after we all got in and started down the river Sean started 
                        making jokes about our heads getting smashed my rocks. I kind of blew it off because he was 
                        likely joking, and I wanted to ask him out when we returned to the launch point - he was too 
                        cute to be creepy. I was enjoying the view of the cliffs and trees when suddenly I noticed 
                        that Sean was holding a large rock in his hand. Before I could respond Kim’s face was smashed 
                        in. Alexis and I jumped into the river and swam as fast as we could to the shore. As we 
                        struggled up the muddy bank, I looked and noticed that Sean was swimming after us. I sprinted 
                        into the woods without looking back. A moment later I heard a scream - Alexis! After a 
                        horrifying and exhausting escape, I reached an old fire road and was picked up by two great 
                        guys named Wessal and Earl. They drove me back to town. I still think Sean has a cute dimple 
                        but after this, I am not going to ask him out.

                    <h3>Really ... flying sharks?</h3>
                    <p class="t-text">
                        I have always wanted to try white water rafting so for our 20 year anniversary my husband 
                        Phil and I booked a trip. It was going to be so wonderful. The whole rafting experience was 
                        going to be about an hour long. I was worried about piranhas or alligators in the water but 
                        our guide assured me that the worst thing we could encounter was maybe a snapping turtle, 
                        but even that was unlikely. A portion of the river was calm and I let myself relax and take 
                        in the air and sweet sunshine. Suddenly I saw something fly up over the trees on the mountain 
                        side. At first it seems like a bird but I quickly ruled that out because it was big - very big 
                        - and was twisting and flipping through the sky. I watched in shock as the thing blocked out 
                        the sun and descended upon us. Our raft was annihilated as a great white shark, with gaping 
                        mouth, slammed down upon my husband Phil. The tour guide and I were thrown into the water. He 
                        pulled me to shore and saved my life. He couldn’t save Phil. Phil now filled the belly of the 
                        shark. I will never go rafting again.
